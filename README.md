# OdinRecipes
Repository for the Odin Recipe book project.

The plan is to make a Landing Page with a list of links to different Recipes. I'd like to have an image on the front page and with each recipe, downloaded from pexels.com, a free stock photography site. Photographers will be credited at bottom of this document for photos used. The code from TOP this project will demonstrate will be basic html including lists, links, images, paragraphs, headings, html boilerplate, and assorted attributes.

I am also going to use some code learned on https://www.w3schools.com/ to create a frame to display recipes and use some basic css to style the page.
